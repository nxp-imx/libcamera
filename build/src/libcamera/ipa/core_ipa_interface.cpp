 * \struct IPACameraSensorInfo
 * \brief Report the image sensor characteristics
 *
 * The structure reports image sensor characteristics used by IPA modules to
 * tune their algorithms based on the image sensor model currently in use and
 * its configuration.
 *
 * The reported information describes the sensor's intrinsics characteristics,
 * such as its pixel array size and the sensor model name, as well as
 * information relative to the currently configured mode, such as the produced
 * image size and the bit depth of the requested image format.
 *
 * Instances of this structure are meant to be assembled by the CameraSensor
 * class by inspecting the sensor static properties as well as information
 * relative to the current configuration.
