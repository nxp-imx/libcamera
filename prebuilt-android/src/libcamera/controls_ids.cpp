 * \brief The instantaneous frame duration from start of frame exposure to start

/**
 * \var FrameDurationLimits
 * \brief The minimum and maximum (in that order) frame duration, expressed in
 * microseconds.
 *
 * When provided by applications, the control specifies the sensor frame
 * duration interval the pipeline has to use. This limits the largest
 * exposure time the sensor can use. For example, if a maximum frame
 * duration of 33ms is requested (corresponding to 30 frames per second),
 * the sensor will not be able to raise the exposure time above 33ms.
 * A fixed frame duration is achieved by setting the minimum and maximum
 * values to be the same. Setting both values to 0 reverts to using the
 * camera defaults.
 *
 * The maximum frame duration provides the absolute limit to the shutter
 * speed computed by the AE algorithm and it overrides any exposure mode
 * setting specified with controls::AeExposureMode. Similarly, when a
 * manual exposure time is set through controls::ExposureTime, it also
 * gets clipped to the limits set by this control. When reported in

/**
 * \enum AfModeEnum
 * \brief Supported AfMode values
 *
 * \var AfModeManual
 * \brief The AF algorithm is in manual mode. In this mode it will never
 * perform any action nor move the lens of its own accord, but an
 * application can specify the desired lens position using the
 * LensPosition control.
 *
 * In this mode the AfState will always report AfStateIdle.
 *
 * If the camera is started in AfModeManual, it will move the focus
 * lens to the position specified by the LensPosition control.
 *
 * This mode is the recommended default value for the AfMode control.
 * External cameras (as reported by the Location property set to
 * CameraLocationExternal) may use a different default value.
 *
 * \var AfModeAuto
 * \brief The AF algorithm is in auto mode. This means that the algorithm
 * will never move the lens or change state unless the AfTrigger
 * control is used. The AfTrigger control can be used to initiate a
 * focus scan, the results of which will be reported by AfState.
 *
 * If the autofocus algorithm is moved from AfModeAuto to another
 * mode while a scan is in progress, the scan is cancelled
 * immediately, without waiting for the scan to finish.
 *
 * When first entering this mode the AfState will report
 * AfStateIdle. When a trigger control is sent, AfState will
 * report AfStateScanning for a period before spontaneously
 * changing to AfStateFocused or AfStateFailed, depending on
 * the outcome of the scan. It will remain in this state until
 * another scan is initiated by the AfTrigger control. If a scan is
 * cancelled (without changing to another mode), AfState will return
 * to AfStateIdle.
 *
 * \var AfModeContinuous
 * \brief The AF algorithm is in continuous mode. This means that the lens can
 * re-start a scan spontaneously at any moment, without any user
 * intervention. The AfState still reports whether the algorithm is
 * currently scanning or not, though the application has no ability to
 * initiate or cancel scans, nor to move the lens for itself.
 *
 * However, applications can pause the AF algorithm from continuously
 * scanning by using the AfPause control. This allows video or still
 * images to be captured whilst guaranteeing that the focus is fixed.
 *
 * When set to AfModeContinuous, the system will immediately initiate a
 * scan so AfState will report AfStateScanning, and will settle on one
 * of AfStateFocused or AfStateFailed, depending on the scan result.

 * \brief Sets the focus windows used by the AF algorithm when AfMetering is set
 * to AfMeteringWindows. The units used are pixels within the rectangle

 * In order to be activated, a rectangle must be programmed with non-zero
 * width and height. Internally, these rectangles are intersected with the
 * ScalerCropMaximum rectangle. If the window becomes empty after this
 * operation, then the window is ignored. If all the windows end up being
 * ignored, then the behaviour is platform dependent.
 *
 * On platforms that support the ScalerCrop control (for implementing
 * digital zoom, for example), no automatic recalculation or adjustment of
 * AF windows is performed internally if the ScalerCrop is changed. If any
 * window lies outside the output image after the scaler crop has been
 * applied, it is up to the application to recalculate them.
 *
 * The details of how the windows are used are platform dependent. We note
 * that when there is more than one AF window, a typical implementation
 * might find the optimal focus position for each one and finally select
 * the window where the focal distance for the objects shown in that part
 * of the image are closest to the camera.

 * \brief All pixel data is replaced with an 8-bar color pattern. The vertical
 * bars (left-to-right) are as follows; white, yellow, cyan, green,
 * magenta, red, blue and black. Each bar should take up 1/8 of the
 * sensor pixel array width. When this is not possible, the bar size
 * should be rounded down to the nearest integer and the pattern can
 * repeat on the right side. Each bar's height must always take up the
 * full sensor pixel array height.
 *
 * \var TestPatternModeColorBarsFadeToGray
 * \brief The test pattern is similar to TestPatternModeColorBars,
 * except that each bar should start at its specified color at the top
 * and fade to gray at the bottom. Furthermore each bar is further
 * subdevided into a left and right half. The left half should have a
 * smooth gradient, and the right half should have a quantized
 * gradient. In particular, the right half's should consist of blocks
 * of the same color for 1/16th active sensor pixel array width. The
 * least significant bits in the quantized gradient should be copied
 * from the most significant bits of the smooth gradient. The height of
 * each bar should always be a multiple of 128. When this is not the
 * case, the pattern should repeat at the bottom of the image.
 *
 * \var TestPatternModePn9
 * \brief All pixel data is replaced by a pseudo-random sequence generated
 * from a PN9 512-bit sequence (typically implemented in hardware with
 * a linear feedback shift register). The generator should be reset at
 * the beginning of each frame, and thus each subsequent raw frame with
 * this test pattern should be exactly the same as the last.
 *
 * \var TestPatternModeCustom1
 * \brief The first custom test pattern. All custom patterns that are
 * available only on this camera device are at least this numeric
 * value. All of the custom test patterns will be static (that is the
 * raw image must not vary from frame to frame).
