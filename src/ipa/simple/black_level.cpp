 * \class BlackLevel
 * \brief Object providing black point level for software ISP
 *
 * Black level can be provided in hardware tuning files or, if no tuning file is
 * available for the given hardware, guessed automatically, with less accuracy.
 * As tuning files are not yet implemented for software ISP, BlackLevel
 * currently provides only guessed black levels.
 *
 * This class serves for tracking black level as a property of the underlying
 * hardware, not as means of enhancing a particular scene or image.
 *
 * The class is supposed to be instantiated for the given camera stream.
 * The black level can be retrieved using BlackLevel::get() method. It is
 * initially 0 and may change when updated using BlackLevel::update() method.
