# Neo pipeline platform config file example
#
# This config file format is experimental and subject to change.

# The platform config file allows to define the topology of the entities
# involved in the media devices graphs for every camera. It is needed when
# complex topologies are used that can not be discovered automatically at
# run time by the pipeline implementation.
# Multiple configurations ('platforms') can be specified in the same
# configuration file. A platform corresponds to the resulting topologies of a
# board connected to a set of sensors and possible companion chips like SerDes.
# To select the relevant configuration, pipeline parses at runtime the
# configurations from the file in their definition order. Each configuration
# lists the required entities to be detected so that it is considered as valid.
# As a valid platform configuration is found, it is picked by the pipeline
# that proceeds with its definitions for subsequent pipeline configuration.
#
# Each platform configuration defines:
# - The routings for subdevice entities having streams capability
# - The camera-specific definitions
#
# Routing is global as it may have to be applied to subdevices shared by
# multiple camera graphs. Setting routing resets the routing table and can not
# be applied when the subdevice is active. Thus, routing has typically to be
# applied once at platform startup.
# Routing consists in a set of v4l2 routes. An individual route defines a stream
# crossing an entity from its sink to source pad, so streams are multiplexed on
# entities pad. At pad level, each stream can be configured with a different
# subdevice format.
#
# A camera outputs one or muliple streams flowing from its entity source pad
# down to the ISI pipe. Individual streams end up demultiplexed in separate
# ISI channels and video devices.
# Camera streams may be:
# * input0: main exposure pixel data fed to ISP input0 pad (mandatory)
# * input1: short exposure pixel data fed to ISP input1 pad (optional)
# * embedded: embedded data when sent of side channel (optional)
#

# Nodes definition:
#
# platforms         = sequence of platform-entry
# platform-entry    = mapping of {name, match sequence, routings, cameras}
#
# name              = arbitraty name for the platform configuration
#
# maching           = mapping of {entities}
# entities          = sequence of required entities names to match this platform
#                     config
#
# routings          = sequence of routing-entry
# routing-entry     = mapping of {entity, routes}
# entity:           = name of the entity whose routing is to be configured
# routes:           = sequence of route-entry for that entity
# route-entry       = sequence of parameters for v4l2 route definition listed as
#                     [sink pad, sink stream, source pad, source stream, flags]
#
# cameras           = sequence of individual camera-entry definition
# camera entry      = mapping of {entity, stream-input0, stream-input1, stream-embedded}
# stream-input0
# stream-input1 (optional)
# stream-embedded (optional)
#                   = mapping of {links, isi-pipe, mbus-format, embedded-lines}
# links             = sequence of link-entry listing links from the graph of this camera
# link-entry        = sequence of parameters to describe a link between entities
#                     listed as
#                     [source entity name, source pad, source pad stream,
#                      sink entity name, sink pad, sink pad stream]
# isi-pipe          = ISI pipe channel index [0..N]
#
# \todo remove keys below
# mbus-code (optional)
#                   = mbus-code for this stream (input1 and embedded streams only)
# embedded-lines (optional)
#                   = number of lines of embedded data (embedded stream only)
